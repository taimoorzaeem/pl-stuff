# pl-stuff

This repository contains programs and write-ups related to programming language theory and research.

It mostly contains some practice work for all the PL related books I have read.

## Haskell

The haskell directory contains solutions of exercises from ezyang's [pl-class-public](https://github.com/ezyang/pl-class-public). These exercises were pretty fun and taught me alot about haskell. There is also video lectures on ezyang's youtube channel here [PL Class - Spring 2022](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9sqUxos-K_dOV8k2q6JZN-u78BNJVhwd&si=rU2TojF0QeOX8s5v).

## Racket/Scheme

### The Little Schemer

This is really the basics of functional programming and a kind of introduction into the lisp world.

### The Seasoned Schemer

Gets into some deeper functional programming concepts like building recursive functions, Y-combinator etc.

### The Reasoned Schemer

This one is the most unintuitive for me. I learnt a lot of concepts with this in the logical programming world. The core concepts like constraint solving, defining goals and relationships, unification and reification. Good prerequisite for jumping into Prolog.

### The Little Prover

A good introduction to work with proof assistants. It really teaches the most important concepts in theorem proving such as term rewriting, if-lifting, list induction, star induction and constructing inductive premises for any kind of definitions. If I ever really wanna get into working with proof assistants again, this will be my first pick.

### The Little Typer

Currently reading.
